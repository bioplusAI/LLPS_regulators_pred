To make predictions, follow these steps:

1. Download the "LLPS_regulators_Pred" repository.
2. Import the environment file present in the "Environment" directory.
3. Place your query sequences in FASTA format into the "Input_sequences" file within the "Input_sequences" directory.
4. Upload the "Source_code.ipynb" file from the "Source_code" directory into Jupyter Notebook and run it.
5. The code will take some time to execute initially as it downloads the ESM-2 model. Once the ESM-2 model is downloaded, predictions will be generated within a few seconds.
